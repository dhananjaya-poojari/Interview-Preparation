## SOLID is an acronym that stands for:

- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)


### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Principle: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.

Example:
```

public class Report
{
    public string Content { get; set; }
}

public class ReportPrinter
{
    public void Print(Report report)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(report.Content);
    }
}

public class ReportSaver
{
    public void Save(Report report)
    {
        // Code to save the report
    }
}
```
Here, the Report class is responsible for holding the report content, ReportPrinter is responsible for printing the report, and ReportSaver is responsible for saving the report. Each class has a single responsibility.

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Principle: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

Example:
```
public abstract class Shape
{
    public abstract double Area();
}

public class Circle : Shape
{
    public double Radius { get; set; }

    public override double Area()
    {
        return Math.PI * Radius * Radius;
    }
}

public class Rectangle : Shape
{
    public double Width { get; set; }
    public double Height { get; set; }

    public override double Area()
    {
        return Width * Height;
    }
}
```
The Shape class is closed for modification but open for extension. New shapes can be added by extending the Shape class without modifying existing code.

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Principle: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.

Example:

```
public class Bird
{
    public virtual void Fly()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Flying");
    }
}

public class Sparrow : Bird
{
    public override void Fly()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Sparrow flying");
    }
}

public class Ostrich : Bird
{
    public override void Fly()
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Ostriches can't fly");
    }
}
```
Here, Ostrich violates the Liskov Substitution Principle because it cannot be substituted for Bird without altering the correctness of the program. A better design would avoid using inheritance in this case or handle the inability to fly in a different way.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Principle: Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces they do not use.

Example:

```
public interface IPrinter
{
    void Print();
}

public interface IScanner
{
    void Scan();
}

public class MultiFunctionPrinter : IPrinter, IScanner
{
    public void Print()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Printing");
    }

    public void Scan()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Scanning");
    }
}

public class SimplePrinter : IPrinter
{
    public void Print()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Printing");
    }
}
```
In this example, the IPrinter and IScanner interfaces are segregated. SimplePrinter class does not need to implement IScanner if it only supports printing.

### Dependency Inversion Principle

Suppose we have a NotificationService class responsible for sending notifications to users through various channels such as email, SMS, and push notifications. Initially, the NotificationService class directly depends on concrete implementations of these notification channels:

```
public class EmailNotificationService
{
    public void SendEmail(string recipient, string message)
    {
        // Code to send email
    }
}

public class SMSNotificationService
{
    public void SendSMS(string recipient, string message)
    {
        // Code to send SMS
    }
}

public class PushNotificationService
{
    public void SendPushNotification(string recipient, string message)
    {
        // Code to send push notification
    }
}

public class NotificationService
{
    private readonly EmailNotificationService emailService;
    private readonly SMSNotificationService smsService;
    private readonly PushNotificationService pushService;

    public NotificationService()
    {
        emailService = new EmailNotificationService();
        smsService = new SMSNotificationService();
        pushService = new PushNotificationService();
    }

    public void SendNotification(string recipient, string message)
    {
        emailService.SendEmail(recipient, message);
        smsService.SendSMS(recipient, message);
        pushService.SendPushNotification(recipient, message);
    }
}
```
In the above code, the NotificationService class directly creates instances of EmailNotificationService, SMSNotificationService, and PushNotificationService. This violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because NotificationService is tightly coupled to concrete implementations of notification channels.

To adhere to the DIP, we should introduce abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes) for the notification channels and have NotificationService depend on these abstractions instead of concrete implementations. Here's the refactored code:

```
public interface INotificationService
{
    void SendNotification(string recipient, string message);
}

public class EmailNotificationService : INotificationService
{
    public void SendNotification(string recipient, string message)
    {
        // Code to send email
    }
}

public class SMSNotificationService : INotificationService
{
    public void SendNotification(string recipient, string message)
    {
        // Code to send SMS
    }
}

public class PushNotificationService : INotificationService
{
    public void SendNotification(string recipient, string message)
    {
        // Code to send push notification
    }
}

public class NotificationService
{
    private readonly List<INotificationService> notificationServices;

    public NotificationService(IEnumerable<INotificationService> services)
    {
        notificationServices = services.ToList();
    }

    public void SendNotification(string recipient, string message)
    {
        foreach (var service in notificationServices)
        {
            service.SendNotification(recipient, message);
        }
    }
}
```
In this refactored code:

- We introduced the INotificationService interface representing a generic notification service.
- Each concrete notification service (EmailNotificationService, SMSNotificationService, PushNotificationService) implements this interface.
- The NotificationService class now depends on INotificationService abstraction instead of concrete implementations.
- It accepts a collection of INotificationService instances through its constructor, allowing for easier extensibility and flexibility.
  
By applying the Dependency Inversion Principle, we've decoupled the NotificationService from specific implementations, making it more flexible, testable, and maintainable.
